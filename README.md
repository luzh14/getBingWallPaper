# getBingWallPaper
A gui to get bing wallpaper without watermark, just for fun:)

So I am not sure whether it could run well in your environment.

Acctually you can download bing wallpaper without watermark from certain website like http://www.bing.com/gallery/# 

step:

1. make sure that you have installed required packages in your system.
2. run *pyinstaller.py*
3. you can see there is a dist folder in /getBingWallPaper/dist
4. use GUI in dist folder to download the wallpaper

BTW, if you do not like to create a GUI, you can just run *wallpaper_download.py*. There are some notes at the bottom of *wallpaper_download.py*# getBingWallPaper
